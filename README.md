# Roo Code Tips & Tricks

A collection of files designed to supercharge your Roo Code experience and maximize productivity.

## Introduction

These productivity-enhancing templates can be added to your projects to modify how Roo Code's LLM behaves, creating a more efficient and effective development workflow.

## Available Resources

### [Handoff System](handoff-manager/docs/handoff-system.md)
**Solve the context window overload problem once and for all.**

The Handoff System provides a streamlined approach to manage LLM context across extended development sessions. This innovative system tackles a fundamental issue in extended LLM interactions - as sessions progress, LLMs accumulate context that becomes increasingly bloated with irrelevant information, consuming valuable tokens and degrading performance.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Maintain peak LLM performance** throughout long projects by starting fresh when needed
- **Reduce token consumption and costs** by eliminating redundant context
- **Preserve focus on what matters most** with clean, relevant context windows
- **Break through stubborn debugging challenges** with "fresh eyes" - sometimes a clean perspective solves problems that an overloaded context window cannot
- **Document project progress automatically** as a natural side-effect of the system
- **More streamlined than memory banks** while achieving similar benefits with less complexity
- **Inspired by battle-tested knowledge handoff techniques** refined during intelligence operations where 24/7 situational awareness is mission-critical

During extended debugging sessions, it may feel frustrating to start over with a fresh LLM, but it's often better than continuing down a deteriorating path. The "fresh eyes" of a new session with focused context can break through obstacles that an overloaded session might struggle with.

**Getting Started with the Handoff System:**
1. For a **comprehensive explanation** of the system architecture and concepts, read the [detailed guide](handoff-manager/docs/handoff-system.md)
2. Choose your implementation approach:
   - For a **simple installation** using the automated installer script, follow the [basic installation guide](handoff-manager/docs/basic-installation.md)
   - For a **manual installation** with full customization, follow the [advanced installation guide](handoff-manager/docs/advanced-installation.md)
3. For **usage instructions** after installation, refer to the [usage guide](handoff-manager/docs/usage-guide.md)
4. For **custom mode integration**, refer to [custom modes documentation](cheatsheets/custom-modes-llm-instruction.md)

**Compatibility Note:** Optimized for Claude 3 models with thinking enabled

### [Large File Handling Cheatsheet](cheatsheets/llm-large-file-cheatsheet.md)
A practical cheatsheet of one-liners and code snippets in Python, Bash, Node.js, and PowerShell for handling large files that would normally exceed LLM context windows. Extract exactly what you need without overwhelming your LLM. This file is designed to be given to the LLM as a reference and to remind it how to do some things.

### [Custom Modes LLM Instructions](cheatsheets/custom-modes-llm-instruction.md)
Unlock the full potential of Roo Code's custom modes system with this detailed guide covering data structures, tool groups, file restrictions, and best practices with practical examples. This file is designed to be given to the LLM to create your own specific custom modes.

### [Roo Code Documentation](personal_roo_docs/)
A comprehensive collection of documentation resources for Roo Code, organized by technical depth and audience:

- **[User-Friendly Guides](personal_roo_docs/normal/)**: Practical guides for everyday Roo Code users covering features, customization, and best practices without technical complexity. Use these to understand what's going on to decide if you need to feed a technical doc into the llm for some purpose.
- **[Technical Documentation](personal_roo_docs/technical/)**: In-depth technical documentation for developers and advanced users who want to understand implementation details. The original goal of these were to create technical documents that could be fed back into Roo for it to understand subsystems. It works pretty well.
- **[Theoretical Improvements](personal_roo_docs/theoretical/)**: Proposals for potential enhancements to Roo-Code, including sophisticated algorithms and architectural improvements. These documents are not part of the current implementation but offer a glimpse into possible future features.


## Getting Started

Each resource includes detailed implementation instructions within its files. Simply clone this repository, copy the desired files into your project, and follow the specific setup instructions within each resource.

**Recommended Learning Path:**
1. Start with the [Handoff System architecture overview](handoff-manager/docs/handoff-system.md) to understand the concepts
2. Choose your implementation path:
   - For simple installation, follow the [basic installation guide](handoff-manager/docs/basic-installation.md)
   - For manual installation, follow the [advanced installation guide](handoff-manager/docs/advanced-installation.md)
3. Refer to the [usage guide](handoff-manager/docs/usage-guide.md) to learn how to use the system
4. Explore the [custom modes documentation](cheatsheets/custom-modes-llm-instruction.md) for advanced integration
5. Reference the [Large File Handling Cheatsheet](cheatsheets/llm-large-file-cheatsheet.md) for complementary techniques
6. Check out the [Roo Code documentation](personal_roo_docs/) for general usage guidance
