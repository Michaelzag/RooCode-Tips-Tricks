# Theoretical Improvements for Roo-Code

This directory contains theoretical proposals for enhancing Roo-Code's functionality. Each document outlines potential improvements that could be implemented in future versions, providing detailed technical approaches and considerations.

## Available Proposals

### [Smart Content-Aware Sliding Window](sliding-window-enhancement.md)

A proposal to enhance Roo-Code's sliding window implementation with content-aware compression techniques. Instead of removing entire older messages, this approach would selectively compress message content based on importance, age, and type, allowing Roo to maintain more conversation context within the same token limits.

### [Full Conversation History Export](full-conversation-history-export.md)

A proposal to maintain and provide access to the complete conversation history, even after the sliding window has removed older messages from the active context. This enhancement would ensure users can always export their entire conversation, not just what's currently visible to the AI.

## Purpose of These Documents

These theoretical documents serve several purposes:

1. **Future Planning**: Outlining potential roadmap items for Roo-Code development
2. **Technical Exploration**: Investigating complex enhancements before implementation
3. **Design Documentation**: Providing detailed technical designs for proposed features
4. **Discussion Starters**: Facilitating conversation about possible improvements

## Contributing to Theoretical Improvements

When creating new theoretical improvement documents, consider:

1. **Problem Statement**: Clearly define the limitation or issue being addressed
2. **Current Implementation**: Analyze how things work today
3. **Proposed Approach**: Detail the technical implementation of the improvement
4. **Challenges and Considerations**: Discuss potential difficulties and edge cases
5. **Benefits**: Outline the expected improvements for users
6. **Implementation Plan**: Provide a phased approach to building the enhancement

New theoretical documents should be added to this directory and referenced in this README.
