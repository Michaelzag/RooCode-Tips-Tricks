# Experimental Features in Roo-Code

## What Are Experimental Features?

Experimental features are new capabilities in Roo-Code that are still being refined. They give you early access to powerful tools before they become standard features. You can enable them individually to try them out and see which ones improve your workflow.

## Available Experimental Features

### 1. Unified Diff Strategy

**What it does**: Provides a more sophisticated way for Roo to make changes to your code files. It uses context-aware matching to find the right places to make changes, even in complex files.

**When to use it**: Enable this feature when:
- Roo has trouble making changes to complex files
- You're working with large files that have similar sections
- You need more detailed error messages when changes fail

**Benefits**:
- More reliable code changes, especially in complex files
- Better handling of similar code sections
- More helpful error messages that explain why a change failed

**Things to watch for**:
- May take slightly longer to process changes
- Occasionally behaves differently than the standard strategy

### 2. Search and Replace Tool

**What it does**: Lets Roo find and replace text across your files using pattern matching. This makes systematic changes much easier.

**When to use it**: Enable this feature when:
- You need to rename variables or functions consistently
- You're updating API calls throughout your code
- You want to standardize coding patterns across files

**Benefits**:
- Make consistent changes across multiple files
- Replace complex patterns with new implementations
- Maintain proper formatting during replacements

**Things to watch for**:
- Always review the changes before committing them
- Be specific with search terms to avoid unintended replacements

### 3. Insert Content Tool

**What it does**: Allows Roo to add new content at specific line positions without changing existing code. This is perfect for adding new functions, imports, or documentation.

**When to use it**: Enable this feature when:
- Adding new functions or methods to existing files
- Inserting import statements at the top of files
- Adding documentation blocks to your code
- Making multiple insertions in one operation

**Benefits**:
- Adds code without modifying existing content
- Preserves proper indentation automatically
- Can insert at multiple positions in one operation

**Things to watch for**:
- Requires specifying the exact line numbers for insertion
- May need adjustments for surrounding context

### 4. Power Steering Mode

**What it does**: Makes Roo follow instructions and role definitions more strictly. This helps when precision and adherence to guidelines are important.

**When to use it**: Enable this feature when:
- Working with strict coding standards or guidelines
- Performing tasks that require precise adherence to rules
- Using detailed custom rules that need to be followed exactly

**Benefits**:
- More consistent adherence to project rules
- Better results for specialized tasks
- Improved following of custom instructions

**Things to watch for**:
- Uses more of your available context space
- May produce more detailed but slightly slower responses

### 5. Multi-Block Search and Replace

**What it does**: Allows Roo to update multiple code blocks in a file in a single operation. This makes coordinated changes across different parts of a file much easier.

**When to use it**: Enable this feature when:
- Changing function signatures that appear in multiple places
- Updating component props throughout a file
- Making coordinated changes that need to happen together
- Refactoring code that has multiple related sections

**Benefits**:
- Make consistent changes across different parts of a file
- Ensure related changes happen together
- Save time compared to multiple separate operations
- Prevent partial updates that could break your code

**Things to watch for**:
- More complex operations require clear instructions
- Review changes carefully before accepting them

## How to Enable Experimental Features

You can enable these features through the Roo-Code settings:

1. Click the Settings gear icon in the Roo sidebar
2. Navigate to the "Experimental Features" section
3. Toggle the features you want to try
4. Start using them in your workflow

## Effective Usage Strategies

### Testing New Features

1. Start with non-critical files when trying experimental features
2. Make sure you have your work committed to version control
3. Review changes carefully before accepting them
4. Try one feature at a time initially to understand its impact

### Combining Features

Some features work particularly well together:

- Use Unified Diff Strategy with Power Steering for precise refactoring
- Combine Search and Replace with Insert Content for comprehensive codebase updates
- Use Multi-Block Search and Replace with Unified Diff Strategy for complex refactoring

### Project-Specific Configuration

You can configure experimental features per project by adding to your `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "roo-cline.experiments": {
    "experimentalDiffStrategy": true,
    "insert_content": true,
    "search_and_replace": false,
    "powerSteering": false,
    "multi_search_and_replace": true
  }
}
```

This way, you can enable different features for different projects based on their specific needs.

## When to Disable Features

Consider disabling experimental features when:

- You encounter unexpected behavior
- You're working on critical production code
- Performance is a priority
- You're about to update Roo-Code to a new version

Remember that experimental features may change behavior between updates as they're refined based on user feedback.
