- Advanced users who want to understand internal implementation details
- Those feeding technical information back to Roo for enhanced understanding of its own systems

## Technical Implementation Patterns

Throughout the documentation, you'll find these common implementation patterns:

1. **Component Architecture**: Most systems use a modular component-based design
2. **File-based Configuration**: Configuration is typically stored in files with specific formats
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Many features involve sophisticated prompt construction techniques
4. **Layered Validation**: Input validation occurs at multiple levels for security and reliability
5. **Runtime Adaptation**: Systems dynamically adapt based on context and environment
